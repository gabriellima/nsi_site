How to Install
--------------

Your system need to have at least python2.6 and some native dependencies, for installing them::

    $ apt-get install python-dev

    $ apt-get install libxml2 libxslt1.1 libxslt1-dev


For installing all dependencies (if needed) and run all tests::

    $ make


Developers should add any new dependency to Makefile.
