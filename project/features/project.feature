Feature: Project maintenance
  As a NSI member
  I want to maintain projects data
  In order to keep the site up to date regarding our projects


  Scenario Outline: Project inclusion
    Given I am on the new project page
    When I fill in "Name" with "<name>"
    And I fill in "Description" with "<description>"
    And I fill in "Situation" with "<situation>"
    And I fill in "Start date" with "<start date>"
    And I fill in "End date" with "<end date>"
    And I press "Save"
    Then I should see "Project: <name>"
    And I should see "Description: <description>"
    And I should see "Situation: <situation>"
    And I should see "Start date: <start date>"
    And I should see "End date: <end date>"

  Examples:
    | project          | description                     | situation | start date | end date |
    | world domination | NSI plans to conquer the galaxy | opened    | 03/2002    |          |
